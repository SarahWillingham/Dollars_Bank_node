# Console Banking App (Node.js)

This is a simple console-based banking application written in Node.js. It allows users to create and manage accounts entirely from the command line with no graphical user interface.

## Features

- Create new accounts secured by a 4-digit PIN
- Access existing accounts
- Check account balances
- View recent transactions
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- Update account PIN

All actions are performed through a text-based interactive menu using Node.js's `readline` module.
